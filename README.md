# Audio-Bleeding-Removal
Neural Network for Removal of bleeding in carnatic music (Saraga dataset) for the application of Music Source Separation.

## Dynamic Frame Input Autoencoder (Spectrogram)
The architecture is tested with artifically bleeded MUSDB18HQ and the bleed is removed.
### Results
| Metrics | Vocal | Bass | Drums | Others | Overall |
